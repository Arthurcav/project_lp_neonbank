⚡️ Neon Bank - Page Redesign Project.

This project consists of a redesigned boarding page for Neon's Bank page. During development, I acquired in-depth knowledge about HTML structuring, CSS styling and the use of the Sass preprocessor. Furthermore, the project is fully responsive and I explored the use of Flexbox a lot. Here are some of the highlights:

📚 Main Skills Used in the Project:

Development in HTML: the project requests the construction of a plausible, organized and hierarchical structure for the good development of the different styling layers.

CSS and Sass styling: the two languages ​​were used with the aim of developing the most productive and clean customization code as possible;

Responsiveness: adaptations were made to the website so that it responds appropriately and user-friendly on the most different screen formats. 📱💻

🌐 I hope you enjoyed it, see you next time!
